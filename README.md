## Here is your deployment checklist ðŸš€

- Run `anchor build`. Your program keypair is now in `target/deploy`. Keep this keypair secret. You can reuse it on all clusters.
- Run `anchor keys list` to display the keypair's public key and copy it into your `declare_id`! macro at the top of `lib.rs`.
- Run `anchor build` again. This step is necessary to include the new program id in the binary.
- Change the `provider.cluster` variable in `Anchor.toml` to `devnet`.
- Run `anchor deploy`
- Run `anchor test`
